//  what is hash table
// --> hash tables are used to store key-value pairs
// --> they are like arrays , but the keys are not ordered

// --> unlike arrays hash tables are fast for all the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values

// why should i care
// -> nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structure
// ->  because of thier speed, hash tables are very commonly used
